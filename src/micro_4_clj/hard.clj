"Analyze a Tic-Tac-Toe Board"
"A tic-tac-toe board is represented by a two dimensional vector. X is represented by :x, O is represented by :o, and empty is represented by :e. A player wins by placing three Xs or three Os in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row. Write a function which analyzes a tic-tac-toe board and returns :x if X has won, :o if O has won, and nil if neither player has won."
